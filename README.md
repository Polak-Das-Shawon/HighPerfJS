### Boost JS Performance
-------
Learning rules, best practices, jsLints or jsHints do not help you to write faster javascript. Because you forget them before you learn. Its not about the rules somebody tells you to follow blindly. Rather its the reasons or the process in the language that makes something faster than others. 

You don’t need to be an expert to write faster JavaScript.

By being aware of how certain things work, you can write faster javascript array, loop, scope, event bubble, closure, DOM manipulation, etc. After this talk, your grandma could understand and make her own standards or best practices for you.

“Don’t trust a rule, trust your tool”. "Explore and ask before you jump. Don't do a belly flop!"
